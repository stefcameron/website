# Jest toBeDefined expectation

I just realized something very important: In Jest, `toBeDefined()` should be used explicitly to check if a value is _not undefined_ (`value !== undefined`). It should not be used to check if a value is anything other than `undefined`. If `null` is also bad for you, then you might be better served by `toBeTruthy()`, which will blow-up ðŸ’¥ if the expectation results in `undefined` or `null` (or empty string, or zero, or `false`).

So far, I've been incorrectly using `toBeDefined()` to make sure that DOM queries with `querySelector()` are working, which is bad because `document.querySelector()` will return `null`, not `undefined`, if the node isn't found, and `toBeDefined()` is happy with `null`... For this type of test, use `toBeInTheDocument()` (which probably tests for "not `null`" behind the scenes).
