Google Maps isn't the best tool for doing what I need to do: Mapping out a 21km half marathon training route.

Instead, check out [Strava's Route Builder](https://www.strava.com/athlete/routes) or [RideWithGPS](http://ridewithgps.com/). RideWithGPS probably has the best mapping tool in the industry, even though their webapp is focused only on cycling; but you can still use the map tool to build a running route.

You might also like [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) which has a very different take on building routes from the others.

Personally, I tend to use Garmin Connect's Course Builder, but I'm not sure if you can use that without having a Garmin device. It's not the best (as in, it has bugs) but it lets you set a goal pace and then will give you a time estimate based on that pace, and will set the virtual partner to that pace so you can race against him or her.

Strava will use your most recent runs to estimate how long your route will take (which is not the same as setting your goal pace; and this will probably not work if you aren't paying for Strava). Strava will also use data from its 60+ million subscribers to guide you on your route (on the most popular roads, based on the heat map).

RideWithGPS will also estimate, but only if you pay. I would say 80-85% of all organized events (cycling and running) tend to showcase their routes on RideWithGPS.

Use one of those tools, and then use Google Street View to check-out parts of your route you aren't sure of (e.g. the route builder says you can run through this forest, but you aren't sure there's actually a path there, or it tells you that you can run through this neighborhood, but you think it might be gated and you can't actually run through it).
