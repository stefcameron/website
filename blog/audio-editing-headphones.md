I'm quickly discovering that iPhone earbuds aren't cutting it for [sound editing](./audio-compression-101.md). I'm now looking for a quality pair of headphones, and I found this great [post](https://jonnyelwyn.co.uk/film-and-video-editing/what-are-the-best-headphones-for-film-editors/) by a Film Editor about how to choose the right headphones for what I'm trying to do!
