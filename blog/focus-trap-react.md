Today, I became a maintainer on someone else's OSS project for the very first time: [focus-trap-react](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react) :ðŸŽ‰

I'm currently using this module for my work on our Design System at [Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com). The [author](https://github.com/davidtheclark) had been seeking maintainers for his project (and [focus-trap](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap) and [tabbable](https://github.com/davidtheclark/tabbable), among others, in the same vein) for quite some time, so I hope to breathe some new life into it by merging a few long-standing PRs and updating all the dependencies, for starters.
