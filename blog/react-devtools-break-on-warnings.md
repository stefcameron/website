# React DevTools break on warnings

FYI, if you use [React DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and suddenly, for the past couple of days, you keep automatically (annoyingly!) hitting a breakpoint related to [break on warnings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62835806/react-dev-tools-deactivate-break-on-warnings) because, apparently, you enabled the _break on warnings_ feature in React DevTools (but you actually never enabled it, and it's actually unchecked), you need to check it, then uncheck it, so it stops bugging you! I'm guessing a recent update introduced a bug that has it on by default without checking the state of the settings. ðŸ’¥
